## Initial Setup
Initial Setup has been completed. The front end has the bare minimum required to laod and serves as an empty scaffolding for the new project. Placeholder content has been removed, such as styles and welcome components

For the back end, the basic utilities are installed.
dotenv to hide credentials, cors for security bypass for local development, mongoose for db connection,
and express to handle functionality. Inital connections established but no routes defined yet

## Create Post
New component CreatePost.vue added, and a basic form with v-model for text and a listener for file selection added.
For basic styling, sass was added using `npm add -D sass` to make the form a bit tidier while developing.
